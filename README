Version 3.0 version Version 2.x
-------------------------------
DuMux 3.0 stable release has recently been published. Therefore, we are now in the process of porting all our examples to the new 
Version 3.0. 
All examples in the folder rosi_benchmarking already work.
All examples in the folder rosi_examples are still based on the old version and thus need the corresponding versions of Dune and DuMux
modules. Working examples based on the old version can be found on the branch archiveDumux2.
