\chapter*{Example 3: Contaminated root by benzo{[}a{]}pyrene (BaP) transport}

\section*{Model}

This example investigates the tranport of a contaminant in soil and
diffusive uptake by root. The contaminant chemical is benzo{[}a{]}pyrene
(BaP) which has chemical formula of $C_{20}H_{12}$

\subsection*{The soil sub-problem}

The transport of BaP in soil is described by two equations: the Richards
equation and the transport (convection - diffussion) equations in
3D soil domain. The Richards equation is formulated in multi-phase
flow context as

\[
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\rho_{w}\Phi S\right)-\nabla\cdot\left[\rho_{w}\frac{\kappa}{\mu}K\left(\nabla p_{w}-\rho_{w}\boldsymbol{g}\right)\right]=q_{w}
\]

with $t$ - time $[s]$, $\theta$ water content, $S$ saturation,
$\Phi$ porosity, $S\phi=\theta$, $\rho_{w}$ water density, $K$
intrinsic permeability, $\mu$ dynamic viscosity, $\kappa$ relative
permeability, $q_{w}$ sink term for water uptake, $\boldsymbol{g}$
gravitational acceleration, $p_{w}$ absolute pressure of wetting
phase (water)\footnote{$p_{w}$is the absolute pressure. The matric pressure $p_{m}$ is
defined as $p_{m}=p_{w}-p_{a}$, where $p_{a}$ is the air pressure,
assumed to be constant and equal to $1x10^{5}$ Pa in this Richards
equation model. In order to have head units, we need to convert the
water potential from energy per unit volume of water (pressure) to
energy per unit weight, i.e., $h_{m}=\frac{p_{m}}{\rho_{w}\boldsymbol{g}}$}. $\theta$ and $h_{m}$ are related by the water retention curve:
$\theta:=\theta(h)$ (e.g. van Genuchten model) and $K_{c}=\frac{Kk_{r}w\varrho_{w}g}{\mu_{w}}$
. The simulation domain is a rectangular block of soil, $\Omega_{s}$,
and we prescribe uniform initial conditions and no-flux boundary conditions
at the outer faces $\partial\Omega_{s}$, i.e., 
\begin{eqnarray}
p_{w}=p_{w,0} & \text{ at } & t=0\\
\frac{\kappa}{\mu}K\left(\nabla p_{w}-\rho_{w}\boldsymbol{g}\right) \cdot \mathbf{n}=0 & \text{ at } & \partial\Omega_{s}
\end{eqnarray}

The transport equation for contaminant BaP is

\[
\phi\frac{\partial\rho_{w}X_{c}S}{\partial t}-\nabla \cdot (D\rho_{w}\nabla X_{c})-\nabla \cdot (\rho_{w}X_{c}\kappa_{r}\frac{\kappa}{\mu}(\nabla p_{w}-\rho_{w}g))=q_{c}
\]

with $X_{c}$ is mass or mole fraction of transported component (in
this example is the mass fraction of BaP); $D$ is dispersive - diffusive
coefficient of component in soil solution and $q_{c}$ is sink term
for plant-root uptake. The inital conditions and boundary condition
as contant mass fraction at the outer soil domain:
\begin{eqnarray}
X_{c}=X_{c0} & \text{ at } & t=0\\
X_{c}=X_{c0} & \text{ at } & \partial\Omega_{s}
\end{eqnarray}


\subsection*{The root system sub-problem}

We solve a modified version of the Richards equation on the 1D network
in 3D space that describes the root architecture. We assume that the
root is fully saturated with water, i.e., S=1. We further follow the
cohesion-tension theory wherein pressure gradients are the driving
force for water movement from soil through plants to the atmosphere.
Thus, there is negative absolute pressure inside the xylem\footnote{Water can be liquid at negative pressure (metastable) (Caupin et al.
2013). Constitutive relations e.g. between pressure and density are
less known in this state (Davitt et al. 2010). However, in our simulations,
we assume constant pressure}.

\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\rho_{w}\Phi\overbrace{S}^{=1}\right)-\nabla\cdot\left[\rho_{w}K_{x}\left(\nabla p_{w}-\rho\boldsymbol{g}\right)\right]=\rho_{w}q_{w,r},
\end{eqnarray}
with $K_{x}$ axial conductance and $q_{w,r}$ the sink term for water
uptake by an individual root segment.

We prescribe zero initial conditions and no-flux boundary conditions
at the root tips. At the root collar, we prescribe the water flux
equal to the potential transpiration rate T$_{pot}$ as long as the
pressure at the root collar is above a certain threshold value. When
the pressure at the root collar reaches this threshold value, the
boundary condition is switched to a dirichlet condition where the
pressure is prescribed to be equal to the threshold value. 
\begin{eqnarray}
p_{w}=0 & \text{ at } & t=0\\
K_{x}\left(\nabla p_{w}-\rho\boldsymbol{g}\right) \cdot \mathbf{n}=0 & \text{ at the root tips}\\
\rho_{w}K_{x}\left(\nabla p_{w}-\rho\boldsymbol{g}\right) \cdot \mathbf{n}=T_{pot} & \text{ at the root collar} & \text{ if }p_{w}>p_{w,c}\\
p_{w}=p_{w,c} & \text{ at the root collar} & \text{ if }p_{w}\le p_{w,c},
\end{eqnarray}
where $T_{pot}$ is the potential transpiration rate, and $p_{w,c}$
is the critical water pressure (as absolute pressure, permanent wilting
point PLUS air pressure!).

The transport of nutrient or contaminant in the root system is described
by the convective diffusive equation.

\[
\phi\frac{\partial\rho X_{c}S}{\partial t}-\nabla \cdot (D\rho\nabla X_{c})-\nabla \cdot (\rho X_{c}K_{x}\left(\nabla p_{w}-\rho_w\boldsymbol{g}\right))-q_{c}=0
\]

For the boundary conditions, we describe a free outflow boundary at the root colar and zero flux at root tip

\begin{eqnarray}
X_{c}=0 & \text{ at } & t=0\\
\left(D\rho_w\nabla X_{c} - \rho_w X_{c}K_{x}\nabla p_{root}\right) \cdot \mathbf{n}=0 & \text{ at the root tips}\\
\left(D\rho_w\nabla X_{c}\right)\cdot \mathbf{n} & \text{ at the root collar}
\end{eqnarray}


\subsection*{Coupling the soil and the root system subproblems}

The soil and root system subproblems are coupled via the sink term
for root water uptake. Water flow across the root membrane is driven
by the pressure gradient between each root segment and its surrounding
soil.

For each root segment, the radial flux of water $q_{w,r}$ is given
by 
\begin{eqnarray}
q_{w,r}=2\pi rlK_{r}(p_{w,root}-p_{w,soil}),
\end{eqnarray}
where $K_{r}$ is the root hydraulic conductivity, $r$ is the root
radius, $l$ is the length of the root segment, $p_{w,root}$ is the
absolute pressure inside the root segment, and $p_{w,soil}$ is the
local absolute water pressure of the soil at this root segment.

Uptake from soil is computed by summing over the root segments that
lie inside each soil control volume $V$, i.e., 
\begin{eqnarray}
q_{w,V}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left(2\pi r_{i}fl_{i}K_{r,i}(p_{w,root,i}-p_{w,soil})\right),
\end{eqnarray}
where $N$ is the number of root segments that lie inside $V$, $f$
is the fraction of root segment length that lies inside $V$.

The passive transport of contaminant $q_{c}$ $[kg.s^{-1}]$ is based
on diffusive flux from soil to root segment through the root membrane

\[
q_{c,r}=\frac{2\pi rl}{V_r}D_{membrane}\rho_{w}(X_{cRoot}-X_{cSoil})
\]

Uptake from soil is computed by summing over the root segments that
lie inside each soil control volume $V_s$, i.e.,

\[
q_{c,V_s}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left(\frac{1}{V_s}2\pi r_{i}fD_{membrane}\rho_{w}(X_{c,root}-X_{c,soil})\right)
\]

where $N$ is the number of root segments that lie inside $V_s$, $f$
is the fraction of root segment length that lies inside $V_s$.

\subsection*{Technical issues}

\subsubsection*{Solver}

The default solver of all dumux-rosi examples is an iterative solver.
In rosiRichards2ctestproblem the solver can be set in line 69: 
\begin{lstlisting}
SET_TYPE_PROP(RosiRichardsTwoCBufferTestProblem, LinearSolver, ILU0BiCGSTABBackend<TypeTag>);
\end{lstlisting}

At moment, the properties of component tranport is setup and hard
coded. It would be better that the definition of component and all
its properties (molar density, diffusion coefficient..) be moved to
the input file for the ease of use.
